# Weather-Dashboard
## Week six Server-side API's

Week sixes challenge goal was to create a weather dashboard from scratch.

I did this by creating form inputs, so:
- When the user searches for a city, then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city
- When the current weather conditions are viewed, then they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
When the UV index is viewed, then they are presented with a color to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- When the user views the future weather for that city,
then they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representative of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
- When the user clicks on a city in the search city, then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.
